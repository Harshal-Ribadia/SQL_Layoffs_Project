Layoffs SQL Project
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of real-world tech industry layoffs using raw SQL queries in MySQL 8.0. It aims to demonstrate how SQL can be leveraged to explore, clean, and extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. The analysis progresses from fundamental data exploration techniques to advanced analytical queries, showcasing the power of SQL in data analysis and business intelligence.

üìã Project Description
The tech industry frequently experiences workforce changes, and layoffs can have significant economic and social impacts. This project dives into publicly available tech layoffs data to uncover trends and patterns that help understand these events better.

Using MySQL 8.0, this project systematically walks through the following stages:

Basic Data Exploration: Learn to select relevant data, filter records, and aggregate results with grouping and counting.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, parse and format dates, and ensure data consistency.

Trend Analysis: Examine layoffs over time, by company, and across different industries to identify patterns.

Pattern Recognition: Apply window functions and scoring methods to assess risk and highlight companies or periods with high layoff activity.

The goal is not only to gain insights into layoffs but also to strengthen SQL skills that are widely applicable in data analysis roles.
